I don't know if I'm in the minority for this or if all tech writers feel this way, but my hot take is that chatspeak is the best way to communicate in the workplace and in general (lol).

## The "Official Writer" effect

Most of my positions so far have been remote, so most of my introductions with coworkers have been through text. Now, I understand that you always want to put your best foot forward when introducing yourself to a coworker for the first time, but so far, most of the messages people have sent me have been something like this: 

> Greetings Abby! It is a pleasure to meet you. I am [name], and I am a [title] here. I was wondering if you would be so kind as to share your availability for this week? I have a request for you that I would greatly appreciate your time on should the opportunity arise. Thank you!

They were well-formatted, had correct grammar and punctuation, and felt very formal. For a little while, I tried to match that tone because I assumed that's what made people feel more comfortable, and I didn't mind. However, I started to notice that the requests that I got from colleagues tended to try to continue to follow that similar tone: very formal, rather long-winded, and using business jargon that sometimes wasn't even used the right way. Because of this, it took a lot of back and forth to get answers to what I thought would be simple questions:

1. What is the problem?
2. What is the ask?

This was my first time working in a fully remote company that worked over Slack, so I kind of assumed that this was just how people spoke in business chats. However, I started to notice in some other public threads that the same people were very casual in other conversations. This included colleagues whom I worked with directly and I was fairly certain were quite comfortable with me. 

So I started a small experiment. Instead of replying with something like "Hello fellow human! I am also enthused to make your acquaintance!", I started saying "hi nice to meet u too :) what's up?" 

And inexplicably, my colleagues dropped the pretense and started speaking more casually to me.
