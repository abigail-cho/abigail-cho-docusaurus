A sample API document written for a fake weather application, GetMyWeather. GetMyWeather is a forecast service that shows forecast information at a time and place. This application is unique because it allows users to get the weather at different levels, from a state to an individual address, with the `specificity` parameter.

This was done as a personal project. You can view the PDF of the sample below or download it <a href="/GetMyWeather-sample.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
